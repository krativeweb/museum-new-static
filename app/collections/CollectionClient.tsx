The usage of leather symbolises the struggles of marginalised communities, and the hand-stitched element of the portrait transforms the struggles into a symbol of pride and resistance. Echoing the constitutional ideals of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity that Ambedkar embodied."

Votus is a play on the Lotus, which we find often in the artwork of the Constitution as a decorative and metaphorical element. This artwork seeks to make the voting ink on the finger-petals of this bloom the enduring national symbol – over and above all connotations. The blooming success of nation-building lies in the power of the vote of the people, rising from the earth of the nation. It is how diversity can live on and disparity cease to exist."
